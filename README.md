"It Lives!"

To install:

`gem install thin bundler`

then

`gem install x10-cm17a` (May require root privilages)

then

`bundle install`

then

`thin start`

then it should start!

##Required Hardware
1. X10 Interface (Firecracker, USB, etc..)
2. Linux Server running Ruby (Windows is an option, however the X10 Library contains a C extension and requires you to have a C build environment to install from source.)

That's all for now! More coming soon...
