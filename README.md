# LightControl
"It Lives!"

LightControl allows you to take advantage of Sinatra's web interface to control lights and appliances in your home, office, or dorm room!

To install:

`gem install thin bundler`

then

`bundle install`

then

`thin start`

then it should start!

##Required Hardware
1. X10 Interface (Firecracker, USB, etc..)
2. Linux Server running Ruby (Windows is an option, however the X10 Library contains a C extension and requires you to have a C build environment to install from source.)

That's all for now! More coming soon...
